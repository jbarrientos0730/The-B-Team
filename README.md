## What our app does
We wanted to create a walking route oriented schedule generator that shows activity/restaurant recommendations based on distance you'd like to walk conveniently. Users will input their start point, their name, the duration of their trip and how far they are willing to walk per duration. 

## Why our app is useful
Users can create an itinerary that accounts for my budget and time allocation so that they can maximize their time while touring a city.

Users will be able to route for their activities that accounts for walking and maximum distance to increase the city's exposure their awesome boots

As Nancy Sinatra said:

> These boots are made for walking 
> And that's just what they'll do 
> One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you.

## How users can get started with the project
Users can create an account on the Login page. From there, they can proceed to the Home screen and plan out a route in a new neighborhood or city using the input form + route buttons.
