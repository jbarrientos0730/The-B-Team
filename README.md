## The Overplanner Planning Planner for Overplanners
    We wanted to create a walking route oriented schedule generator featuring an activity schedule based on budget and distance the user can walk to conveniently. Users will input their start point, their name, their budget, the duration of their trip and how far they are willing to walk per duration. 

## How To Get Started
    Users can get started by going to the app Home screen, creating an account or logging in with their user credentials. There is also an option to continue as a guest to browse our awesome content. From there, you can set your location and browse nearby restaurants and cool places to walk to (weather permitting).
